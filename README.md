Joined Resolution Sort - Joined, for a better sorting

This algorithm is based on my quick resolution sorting algorithm (which is basically a modified version of quicksort).

Joined Resolution Sort creates multiple virtual machines that work in unison implementing QRS into different chunks of data.
